# 🚀 Slack Integration Quick Start

## Immediate Testing (Demo Mode)

The Slack integration includes a **demo mode** that works without any setup, allowing you to test the UI and functionality immediately.

### Run the Application

```bash
# Navigate to the salon-crm directory
cd salon-crm

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

### Test the Integration

1. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Login to any portal** (Admin, Director, HR, Management, or Staff)
3. **Navigate to the Messages tab**
4. **Click "Connect to Slack"** - This will simulate the authentication process
5. **Explore the features**:
   - Browse role-based channels in the sidebar
   - Send test messages in the chat thread
   - Toggle between different channels
   - Collapse/expand the sidebar
   - View mock user profiles and avatars

### What You'll See

#### Before Authentication
